## The types of model(s) tried:

- KNN,Kmeans Cluster,LogisticRegression,naive gaussian model,

## Your validation results for your model(s):

- Knn(3):0.667
- Kmeans:0.644
- LogisticRegression:0.764
- Naive gaussian model:0.764

## A statement about which model is best :

- LogisticRegression and Naive gaussian model perform the best. Since data contains several catigorical features( Sex,Pclass), these model out performance others is understandable.
